# COMPLETED Folder

> **Purpose**: Store completed tasks (static memory/compressed, weight 50%-80%)

---

## How to Use

1. **AI will automatically move**: When task completes, from `ACTIVE/` to here
2. **File naming format**: `YYYY-MM-DD_task-name_summary.md`
3. **AI remembers summary only**: Detailed process deleted, only core conclusion kept (≤200 words)

---

## Summary File Structure Example

```markdown
# Task Summary: [task name]

**Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Result**: [core conclusion, ≤200 words]

---

*Original task has been compressed, detailed process deleted*
```

---

**Note**:
- For tasks older than 90 days, AI will remind you to archive to `ARCHIVE/` folder
- After archiving, AI can forget the details of these tasks
